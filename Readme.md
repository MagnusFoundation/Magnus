# Magnus

## What is this?

Magnus is supposed to be a very fast p2p file sharing protocol, whilst being relatively simple and easy to use.

## Why not use existing protocols?

Why should I?

## Goals

Magnus doesn't attempt to be a bloated piece of crap that only a few wizards can use, therefore it's goals are very simple and minimalist.

    - Being extremely fast
    - Being relatively secure
    - Being end-to-end encrypted
    - Having a cryptocurrency-like accounts system.
    - No need for a server to perform connection brokerage
    - Optional TOR-like routing over the network for transfers marked "safe"
    - Eventually having a nice and simple GTK based GUI
    - Somehow anonymizing users
    - Having a nice community

If all that sounds like something you want, help me make it by opening issues and PRs!
In the odd case that someone _does_ open a PR, please make sure that the code follows the WebKit style guide and the snake case naming convention whilst being legible, C++ code following the previous codebase's convention.
